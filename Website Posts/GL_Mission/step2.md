# SCORRE Process for GL's Welcome Posts

## Step 2. Choose a central theme / List everything you want to say about your subject

The objective of this step is to narrow the welcome posts down to a manageable amount of information.

### For the welcome posts I have in mind:
1. The audience could be:
    - Friends, family, potential donors, potential prayer partners, ministry leaders we've served, potential ministries and ministry leaders we might serve and work with, random people from the internet

2. The subject will be:
    - Grace Lead, the 501(c)(3) non profit

3. The single aspect of my subject that I will choose as my central theme is:
    -  Grace Lead's Mission (which is to encourage and equip Christian leaders with the grace of Jesus Christ )

### List everything you want to say about Grace Lead in these welcome posts (and then pick one for one welcome post - save the others for later)
